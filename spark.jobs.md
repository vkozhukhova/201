# Spark.Jobs

Based on the information extracted from the Apache Spark repository, the main job types in Spark are:

* **SQL Jobs**: Jobs that involve SQL queries executed using Spark SQL.
* **Non-SQL Jobs**: Jobs that involve operations on RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets).
* **Hive Jobs**: Specific to operations using the Hive Thrift server and CLI services.

In Apache Spark, some jobs have associated SQL queries while others do not due to the following reasons:

1. **Job Type**: Jobs triggered by SQL queries through Spark SQL will have an associated SQL query. Other jobs, like those triggered by direct RDD operations, will not have an associated SQL query.
2. **Execution Tracking**: SQL jobs are tracked and linked with SQL execution IDs, which are then displayed in the Spark UI. Non-SQL jobs do not have this linkage.
3. **Properties and Listeners**: SQL jobs set specific properties and listeners to track and display associated SQL queries, whereas non-SQL jobs do not utilize these mechanisms.

Examples of non-SQL jobs in Apache Spark include:

* Jobs created using RDD transformations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
* Jobs triggered by actions such as `collect`, `count`, and `saveAsTextFile`.
* Jobs involving machine learning algorithms from the Spark MLlib library.
* Graph processing jobs using GraphX.
* Stream processing jobs using DStream API in Spark Streaming.

**SQL Job Properties**

SQL jobs in Apache Spark set specific properties to help in tracking and managing them. Some of these properties include:

* **Job Tags**: Tags that are associated with jobs to help in identifying and managing them. For example, `jobTags` and `sqlJobTags` are used to tag jobs and SQL jobs respectively.
* **Job Group ID**: This property helps in grouping jobs together, making it easier to manage and track them collectively.

**Listeners for SQL Job Tracking**

SQL jobs utilize listeners to monitor and log events associated with SQL executions. Some relevant event listeners include:

* **SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart**: Triggered when a SQL execution starts, allowing the job to be tracked from its initiation.
* **SparkListenerJobStart**: Captures the start of a job and associates it with the relevant properties for SQL jobs.

**Mechanisms for Tracking and Display in UI**

SQL queries associated with jobs are displayed in the Spark UI through mechanisms that include:

* **Adding Job Tags and Group IDs**: SQL jobs set specific tags and group IDs which are then used to display relevant SQL queries in the Spark UI.
* **Use of Listeners**: Listeners like `SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart` and `SparkListenerJobStart` help in capturing SQL execution details and associating them with jobs, making it possible to display SQL queries in the UI.

**Comparison with Non-SQL Jobs**

Non-SQL jobs do not utilize the same mechanisms for tracking and display. They primarily rely on RDD operations and do not set specific SQL-related properties or listeners. Therefore, they lack the detailed SQL query association and tracking that SQL jobs have in the Spark UI.
