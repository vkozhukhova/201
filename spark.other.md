# Spark.Other

The `spark.memory.storageFraction` configuration in Apache Spark determines the fraction of the `spark.memory.fraction` that is allocated for caching data (storage memory). The remaining part of `spark.memory.fraction` is used for execution memory, which includes tasks like shuffles, joins, and aggregations.

By default, `spark.memory.storageFraction` is set to 0.5, meaning that half of the memory allocated by `spark.memory.fraction` will be used for caching data, while the other half is used for execution tasks. Adjusting this value can help optimize performance based on whether your workload is more storage or execution intensive.

With the settings:

* `spark.executor.memory=1g`
* `spark.memory.fraction=0.6`
* `spark.memory.storageFraction=0.5`

On each executor:

* 60% of the executor memory (`1g * 0.6 = 614 MB`) will be allocated for execution and storage.
* Out of this allocated memory, 50% (`614 MB * 0.5 = 307 MB`) will be dedicated to storage.
* The remaining 50% (`614 MB * 0.5 = 307 MB`) will be used for execution tasks.

So, you will have 307 MB for storage and 307 MB for execution on each executor.

\
Memory overhead refers to additional memory allocated beyond the application's main memory requirements to handle various system-level functionalities. In the context of Spark, it includes:

* JVM overheads such as garbage collection and internal JVM data structures.
* Native memory allocations for operations performed by native code.
* Off-heap memory used by Spark for caching, sorting, and shuffling data.

This overhead ensures smooth operation and prevents out-of-memory errors during execution.

The property `spark.kubernetes.memoryOverhead` in Apache Spark specifies the amount of off-heap memory (in megabytes) to be allocated per executor pod. This memory is used for overhead such as JVM overheads, interned strings, other native overheads, and user code execution. It helps prevent out-of-memory errors by ensuring there is sufficient memory available beyond the JVM heap.



The number of SQL queries shown on the SQL tab in the Spark UI depends on:

* **Number of Actions**: Each action (e.g., `collect()`, `count()`, `save()`, etc.) in your Spark application will typically result in a separate SQL query.
* **Complexity of Transformations**: Complex transformations or chains of transformations can lead to multiple SQL queries being generated to optimize the execution plan.
* **Caching and Reuse**: If intermediate results are cached and reused, it can reduce the number of SQL queries generated.
* **Query Optimizations**: Spark's query optimizer (Catalyst) may break down a single logical query into multiple physical queries to improve performance.

These factors collectively determine the total number of SQL queries executed and displayed in the SQL tab.

Skipped stages in Spark can occur for several reasons:

* **Stage Rerun**: If a stage has already been computed and its results are cached, Spark may skip rerunning it if the results are still valid.
* **Speculative Execution**: Spark may start speculative tasks to handle slow-running tasks. If the original task completes before the speculative one, the speculative task is skipped.
* **Job Optimization**: Spark's query optimizer may determine that certain stages are unnecessary based on the logical plan of the query.

These optimizations help improve performance and resource utilization.

The stage "run at DeltaMergeBuilder.scala" and "Delta: Writing merged data" in the Spark UI are both related to Delta Lake's merge operation, but they represent different parts of the process:

* **"run at DeltaMergeBuilder.scala"**: This stage is part of the Delta Lake merge operation, where the `run` method in `DeltaMergeBuilder.scala` is executed. It involves identifying the rows from the source and target datasets that need to be merged based on the specified conditions.
* **"Delta: Writing merged data"**: This stage occurs after the merge logic is determined. It involves the actual writing of the merged data back to the Delta Lake table. This includes applying the changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) to the Parquet files that make up the Delta table.

In summary, "run at DeltaMergeBuilder.scala" is about determining what changes need to be made, while "Delta: Writing merged data" is about applying those changes to the storage.

In the Stages tab of the Spark UI, seeing stages labeled as "parquet at NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java" and "load at NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java" indicates that these stages are related to reading Parquet files and loading data within your Spark application.

* **"parquet at NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java"**: These stages are involved in reading Parquet files. The reference to `NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java` suggests that native methods are being used during the file reading process.
* **"load at NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java"**: These stages are likely related to the loading of data into DataFrames or other Spark structures. Again, the reference to `NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java` indicates that native methods are involved in this process.

The difference between the stages "load at NativeMethodAcessorImpl.java" and "parquet at NativeMethodAcessorImpl.java" in Spark UI is as follows:

* "load at NativeMethodAcessorImpl.java": This stage generally refers to loading data from a source, which could involve reading from various types of data sources including file systems, databases, etc. It focuses on the initial loading of data into Spark.
* "parquet at NativeMethodAcessorImpl.java": This stage specifically refers to operations involving Parquet files, which are a type of columnar storage file format. It deals with reading or writing Parquet files using the native methods provided by the JVM.

These labels often appear when Spark is performing I/O operations, and the specific method references (`NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java`) are indicative of the underlying JVM mechanisms used by Spark for these operations.

Native methods in Java are methods that are implemented in a language other than Java, typically C or C++, and are called from Java code using Java Native Interface (JNI). These methods allow Java programs to interact with native code libraries or perform system-level operations that are not possible directly in Java. They are often used for performance optimization or to access platform-specific features.

Java application memory management inside the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial aspect of how Java applications run efficiently. Here's an overview:

1. **Heap Memory**:
   * **Young Generation**: This is where all new objects are allocated and created. It is further divided into:
     * **Eden Space**: The pool from which memory is initially allocated for most objects.
     * **Survivor Spaces**: Two equally sized spaces (S0 and S1) that hold objects that have survived garbage collection in Eden space.
   * **Old Generation (Tenured)**: This is where long-lived objects are stored after surviving multiple garbage collection cycles in the young generation.
2. **Non-Heap Memory**:
   * **Method Area**: Stores class structures like metadata, constant runtime pool, and the code for methods and constructors.
   * **PermGen (Permanent Generation)**: Pre-Java 8, this was part of the heap that stored class definitions. It has been replaced by Metaspace in Java 8 and beyond.
   * **Metaspace**: In Java 8 and later, this replaces PermGen and stores class metadata. It can grow dynamically as needed.
3. **Stack Memory**:
   * Each thread has its own stack, which stores local variables, partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return.
4. **PC Registers**:
   * Each thread has a Program Counter (PC) register that stores the address of the current instruction being executed.
5. **Native Method Stacks**:
   * Used for native methods written in languages like C or C++.

#### Garbage Collection

The JVM uses garbage collection to reclaim memory used by objects that are no longer reachable in the application. Different algorithms (such as Serial, Parallel, CMS, and G1) can be used for this purpose.

Understanding how memory is managed in the JVM is essential for optimizing application performance and troubleshooting memory-related issues.

\
When running a Spark application, the memory allocated to the Driver process is part of the JVM process's memory. This includes:

* **Heap Memory**: Used for object storage and managed by the JVM garbage collector.
* **Off-Heap Memory**: Managed directly by the Spark application for certain operations (e.g., memory-mapped files).

The amount of memory allocated to the Driver process can be configured using Spark configuration settings such as `spark.driver.memory`.

by default, Spark keeps RDDs in the JVM heap memory. This default storage level is MEMORY\_ONLY, which stores RDDs as deserialized Java objects in the JVM's heap space.

Spark can keep RDDs in off-heap memory using Tungsten's memory management. This is particularly useful for managing large datasets and improving performance by reducing garbage collection overhead. You can enable off-heap memory storage by setting the configuration `spark.memory.offHeap.enabled` to `true` and specifying the off-heap memory size with `spark.memory.offHeap.size`.

You should consider using off-heap memory for DataFrames in Spark in the following scenarios:

* When you need to reduce the overhead of JVM garbage collection, which can be significant for large datasets.
* When your application experiences frequent garbage collection pauses, impacting performance.
* When your workload involves heavy memory usage and you want to manage memory more efficiently.
* When you need to store large amounts of data that exceed the available heap memory.

To enable off-heap memory, set the configuration `spark.memory.offHeap.enabled` to `true` and specify the size with `spark.memory.offHeap.size`.

\
The amount of memory used to keep a 1GB Parquet file in RAM depends on several factors, including:

* The schema and structure of the Parquet file.
* The level of compression applied to the Parquet file.
* The memory format used by Spark (e.g., uncompressed, compressed, serialized).
* The overhead of Spark's in-memory storage management.

To estimate the memory usage for a Parquet file in Spark, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Load the Parquet file into a DataFrame**:

    ```scala
    val df = spark.read.parquet("s3://path-to-your-file/file.parquet")
    ```
2.  **Cache the DataFrame in memory**:

    ```scala
    df.cache()
    ```
3.  **Trigger an action to load the data into memory**:

    ```scala
    df.count()
    ```
4.  **Check the storage memory usage**:

    ```scala
    spark.catalog.clearCache()
    df.persist()
    df.count()
    val memoryUsed = spark.sparkContext.getRDDStorageInfo.map(_.memSize).sum
    println(s"Memory used: $memoryUsed bytes")
    ```

This approach will give you an estimate of the memory used to keep the DataFrame in RAM, considering Spark's internal storage management and overheads.

The `Storage` tab in the Spark UI will remain empty if the DataFrame is not actually cached due to the following reasons:

* **Action Not Triggered**: The DataFrame must be cached by performing an action (e.g., `count()`, `collect()`, etc.) after calling `cache()`.
* **Lazy Evaluation**: Spark uses lazy evaluation, so transformations like `cache()` are not executed until an action is called.
* **Execution Plan**: The DataFrame might not be used in subsequent actions, causing it not to be cached.

Ensure you perform an action on the DataFrame after calling `cache()`

Seeing multiple "Scan Parquet" operators for the same data in Spark UI DAG visualization can occur due to the following reasons:

* **Multiple Actions**: If your Spark application performs multiple actions (e.g., `collect`, `count`, etc.) on the same DataFrame, Spark may re-scan the data unless the DataFrame is cached or persisted.
* **DataFrame Transformations**: Different transformations applied to the DataFrame might cause Spark to re-scan the Parquet file.
* **Optimization**: Spark's Catalyst optimizer might create multiple scan operations for performance optimization purposes.
* **Partitioning**: If your Parquet file is partitioned, Spark might create separate scan operations for each partition.

To avoid redundant scans, consider using `cache()` or `persist()` on the DataFrame

Caching a DataFrame is generally better than performing several scans of the same Parquet file. Here are the reasons:

* **Performance**: Caching avoids repeated I/O operations, which speeds up subsequent actions.
* **Resource Utilization**: Cached data is stored in memory, reducing the load on your storage system.
* **Consistency**: Caching ensures that the data remains consistent across multiple actions.

However, caching can consume significant memory, so it should be used when multiple actions are performed on the same DataFrame. If memory is a constraint, and you only perform a few actions, scanning the Parquet file might be sufficient.

Garbage Collector (GC) overhead refers to the time and resources spent by the JVM to manage memory, including reclaiming memory occupied by unused objects. High GC overhead can lead to performance issues, such as longer task execution times and increased latency.

In the Spark UI, you can monitor GC overhead in the following ways:

* **Executor Tab**: This tab displays information about each executor, including the amount of time spent on garbage collection.
* **Stages Tab**: This tab shows the time spent in GC for each stage.
* **Environment Tab**: Here you can see the JVM settings, including GC configurations.
* **Metrics**: You can also view detailed GC metrics if you have configured metrics reporting.

To access these tabs, navigate to the Spark application's web UI typically available at `http://<driver-node>:4040`.

In Spark, an application is divided into jobs based on actions and transformations applied to RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) or DataFrames. Here is how it works:

1. **Actions Trigger Jobs**: An action (e.g., `count()`, `collect()`, `saveAsTextFile()`) on an RDD or DataFrame triggers the creation of a job.
2. **Stages within Jobs**: A job is divided into stages, which represent a set of tasks that can be executed in a sequence. Stages are determined by shuffle boundaries (i.e., when data needs to be repartitioned).
3. **Tasks within Stages**: Each stage is further divided into tasks, which are the smallest unit of work and are executed in parallel on different partitions of the data.

The Spark UI provides a detailed view of jobs, stages, and tasks, helping you understand how your application is executed.

In the Spark UI, the SQL tab and the Jobs tab provide different views and information:

* **SQL Tab**: This tab displays details about SQL queries executed in the Spark application. It shows the logical and physical plans, query execution times, and metrics specific to SQL operations. It helps understand how SQL queries are translated into Spark operations.
* **Jobs Tab**: This tab shows the jobs triggered by actions in the Spark application. Each job corresponds to an action (like `count()`, `collect()`) and is divided into stages and tasks. It provides an overview of the job execution, including stages, tasks, and execution times.

The SQL tab focuses on SQL query details, while the Jobs tab provides a broader view of the job execution lifecycle in Spark.

The event timeline on the Jobs tab of the Spark UI provides a visual representation of the duration and progress of different stages within a job. Here are the key components:

* **Bars**: Each bar represents a stage of the job.
* **Colors**: Different colors indicate the status of the stages, such as running, succeeded, or failed.
* **Tooltips**: Hovering over a bar provides detailed information about the stage, including its duration and task distribution.
* **Timeline**: The x-axis represents the timeline of job execution, helping to visualize the sequential and parallel execution of stages.

This timeline helps identify performance bottlenecks and understand the execution flow of the job.

An optimal event timeline in the Jobs tab of the Spark UI should have the following characteristics:

* **Minimal Overlap**: Stages should have minimal overlap, indicating efficient resource utilization.
* **Short Duration**: Bars representing stages should be as short as possible, indicating quick execution.
* **Balanced Load**: Tasks within a stage should be evenly distributed across the available executors.
* **No Long Gaps**: There should be no significant gaps between the execution of stages, indicating smooth transitions.
* **Consistent Colors**: Bars should be mostly green (indicating success) and avoid red (indicating failure).

Here is a conceptual example:

```
Job 1: [Stage 0]----[Stage 1]----[Stage 2]----[Stage 3]
Job 2: [Stage 0]----[Stage 1]----[Stage 2]----[Stage 3]
```

Each stage completes quickly and transitions smoothly to the next without long delays or failures.

Broadcast exchange jobs in Spark are used to distribute small datasets to all worker nodes. These jobs are typically run in parallel to optimize the distribution process and improve overall performance. By broadcasting small datasets, Spark ensures that joins and other operations involving these datasets are more efficient, as each worker node has a local copy of the data. This parallel execution helps in reducing the time spent on data shuffling and network communication.

I have only 3 executors but there 10 broadcast exchange jons in the event timepline, why?

Having more broadcast exchange jobs than executors in the event timeline is possible because Spark schedules tasks based on available resources. Here are some reasons why this might happen:

* **Concurrency**: Spark can schedule multiple broadcast exchange operations concurrently to utilize available executor resources efficiently. Even with limited executors, tasks can be queued and executed in parallel as resources free up.
* **Task Queuing**: Broadcast exchange jobs might be queued and executed as executors become available, leading to overlapping timelines.
* **Resource Utilization**: Spark aims to maximize resource utilization by scheduling multiple tasks, including broadcast exchanges, to keep all available executors busy.

This helps ensure that the executors are not idle and are utilized to their full capacity.

Multiple `runJob` entries running in parallel in the event timeline typically indicate that Spark is executing multiple stages or tasks concurrently to maximize resource utilization and efficiency. This parallelism is a key feature of Spark, allowing it to handle large-scale data processing by distributing tasks across multiple executors and cores.&#x20;

Code generation in Apache Spark is a mechanism used to improve the performance of Spark applications by generating optimized code at runtime. Here are some key points:

* **Efficient Execution**: Spark generates Java bytecode at runtime to optimize the execution of certain operations, reducing the overhead associated with interpreted code.
* **Whole-Stage Code Generation**: This technique compiles multiple logical operations into a single optimized function, minimizing the overhead of separate method calls.

In Apache Spark, the following physical operators support code generation:

* `Filter`
* `Project`
* `Aggregate`
* `Sort`
* `Join`
* `Expand`
* `Window`

Explanation of 'columnarToRow' After 'scan parquet' in Spark DAG Visualization

In Spark DAG visualization, the sequence where you see `columnarToRow` after `scan parquet` is due to the following reasons:

1. **Parquet File Scan**:
   * The `scan parquet` operation reads data from Parquet files. Parquet is a columnar storage format, which means it stores data by columns rather than by rows. This format is efficient for read-heavy operations and enables high performance in data processing.
2. **Columnar to Row Conversion**:
   * After reading columnar data with `scan parquet`, Spark often needs to convert this columnar data into rows for further processing. This conversion is handled by the `columnarToRow` operation. The main reason for this conversion is that many Spark operations, such as those involving complex transformations or actions, are optimized for row-based data structures.
3. **Implementation Details**:
   * The `columnarToRow` operation is implemented in classes like `ColumnarRow` and `ColumnarBatchRow` in the Spark SQL module. These classes handle the conversion of columnar data structures to row-based data structures.

This conversion is essential for ensuring compatibility and optimizing the performance of subsequent operations in the Spark DAG.

* [ColumnarRow.java](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ef142c4f204fcdc2382212ae55a71c3f0f6cae1f/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/vectorized/ColumnarRow.java)
* [ColumnarBatchRow.java](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ef142c4f204fcdc2382212ae55a71c3f0f6cae1f/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/vectorized/ColumnarBatchRow.java)
* [ParquetScan.scala](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/ef142c4f204fcdc2382212ae55a71c3f0f6cae1f/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/v2/parquet/ParquetScan.scala)

You can further explore the implementation details in the Spark repository:

I see the following physical operator in spark physical plan. Please explain what does it mean:

BroadcastHashJoin \[A\_SoldTo#4753, A\_Material#4754], \[T\_SoldTo#4829, T\_Material#4830], Inner, BuildLeft, ((NOT (A\_SalesOrderId#4752 = T\_SalesOrderId#4828) AND (A\_OrderCreationDate#4751 >= T\_OrderCreationDate#4827)) AND (date\_add(A\_FactPlanBillingDate#4750, 1) < T\_FactPlanBillingDate#4826))\


The `BroadcastHashJoin` operator in a Spark physical plan is a join operation where one of the tables (or DataFrames) is small enough to be broadcasted to all worker nodes. This allows for efficient joining of large tables with small tables by avoiding the need to shuffle large amounts of data. Here is a breakdown of the specific operator you provided:

* **Join Type**: `Inner` indicates that it is an inner join.
* **Join Condition**: `[A_SoldTo#4753, A_Material#4754], [T_SoldTo#4829, T_Material#4830]` specifies the columns used for the join.
* **Join Strategy**: `BuildLeft` means that the left side of the join (the first table) will be broadcasted.
* **Join Predicate**:
  * `NOT (A_SalesOrderId#4752 = T_SalesOrderId#4828)` ensures that the sales order IDs are not equal.
  * `A_OrderCreationDate#4751 >= T_OrderCreationDate#4827` ensures that the order creation date of the left table is greater than or equal to the order creation date of the right table.
  * `date_add(A_FactPlanBillingDate#4750, 1) < T_FactPlanBillingDate#4826` ensures that the billing date from the left table (with a day added) is less than the billing date from the right table.

In spark physical plan I see the following, explain it

BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(input\[3, string, true], input\[4, string, true])), \[id=#1558]



The `BroadcastExchange` operator in the Spark physical plan is used to broadcast a small dataset to all worker nodes in the cluster. Here's a detailed explanation of the specific `BroadcastExchange` operator you provided:

* **BroadcastExchange**: This indicates that the operator is responsible for broadcasting a small dataset across the cluster to avoid shuffling large datasets.
* **HashedRelationBroadcastMode**: This specifies the broadcast mode. `HashedRelationBroadcastMode` means that a hashed relation is created for the broadcasted data. This is typically used for join operations where the join keys are hashed, allowing for efficient lookup.
* **List(input\[3, string, true], input\[4, string, true])**: These are the columns being used for the broadcast. In this case, it indicates that columns at positions 3 and 4 (both of type `string` and nullable) in the input dataset are being broadcasted.
* **\[id=#1558]**: This is an internal identifier for the broadcast exchange operation.

In summary, this `BroadcastExchange` operation is preparing a small dataset by broadcasting it across all nodes in the cluster using a hashed relation, enabling efficient join operations by avoiding larger data shuffles.

\+- \*(72) Project \[FactPlanBillingDate#25 AS A\_FactPlanBillingDate#4750, OrderCreationDate#27 AS A\_OrderCreationDate#4751, SalesOrderId#38 AS A\_SalesOrderId#4752, SoldTo#9 AS A\_SoldTo#4753, Material#30 AS A\_Material#4754] : : : +- \*(72) Filter ((((((((isnotnull(CsConfirmed#18) AND isnotnull(rn#4687)) AND isnotnull(Allocation#53)) AND isnotnull(OrderProcessingDate#26)) AND (rn#4687 = 1)) AND (Allocation#53 = true)) AND (CsConfirmed#18 = 0.0)) AND (OrderProcessingDate#26 >= 19998)) AND isnotnull(OrderCreationDate#27))

In the provided Spark physical plan snippet, the number `72` appears in two different operators (`Project` and `Filter`). Here's what it means and why the same identifier appears twice:

* **Physical Operator IDs**: The number `72` is an identifier assigned to physical operators in the execution plan. These identifiers help in tracing and debugging the execution process by providing a unique reference to each operator.
* **Reused Operator ID**: The same identifier appearing in multiple lines suggests that the plan reuses the same operator ID for sub-plans or stages within the same logical step. This can happen when multiple operations are tightly coupled or are part of the same stage in the execution pipeline.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the operators:

1.  **Project**:

    ```
    *(72) Project [FactPlanBillingDate#25 AS A_FactPlanBillingDate#4750, OrderCreationDate#27 AS A_OrderCreationDate#4751, SalesOrderId#38 AS A_SalesOrderId#4752, SoldTo#9 AS A_SoldTo#4753, Material#30 AS A_Material#4754]
    ```

    * This operator performs a projection, selecting specific columns from the dataset and possibly renaming them.
2.  **Filter**:

    ```
    +- *(72) Filter ((((((((isnotnull(CsConfirmed#18) AND isnotnull(rn#4687)) AND isnotnull(Allocation#53)) AND isnotnull(OrderProcessingDate#26)) AND (rn#4687 = 1)) AND (Allocation#53 = true)) AND (CsConfirmed#18 = 0.0)) AND (OrderProcessingDate#26 >= 19998)) AND isnotnull(OrderCreationDate#27))
    ```

    * This operator applies a filter condition to the dataset, ensuring only rows meeting the specified criteria are included.

The reuse of the ID `72` might indicate that these operations are part of the same execution stage or are closely related in the execution pipeline, helping Spark to optimize and manage the physical plan more efficiently.



Explain

\*(69) Sort \[SalesOrderId#38 ASC NULLS FIRST, Material#30 ASC NULLS FIRST, SoldTo#9 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0

The `Sort` operator in the Spark physical plan is used to order the rows of the dataset based on specified columns. Here is a detailed breakdown of the operator:

* \*\*\*(69)\*\*: This is the unique identifier for this specific physical operator within the execution plan.
* **Sort**: Indicates that this operation is sorting the data.
* **\[SalesOrderId#38 ASC NULLS FIRST, Material#30 ASC NULLS FIRST, SoldTo#9 ASC NULLS FIRST]**: Specifies the columns and the order for sorting:
  * `SalesOrderId#38 ASC NULLS FIRST`: Sorts the data by `SalesOrderId` in ascending order, placing NULL values first.
  * `Material#30 ASC NULLS FIRST`: Sorts the data by `Material` in ascending order, placing NULL values first.
  * `SoldTo#9 ASC NULLS FIRST`: Sorts the data by `SoldTo` in ascending order, placing NULL values first.
* **false**: Indicates that the sort is not global; it's a local sort within each partition.
* **0**: Represents the sort order, which is likely the default sort order in this context.

In summary, this operator sorts the dataset by the specified columns (`SalesOrderId`, `Material`, and `SoldTo`) in ascending order, with NULL values placed at the beginning for each column within each partition.

I see the following physical operator in the spark physical plan:\
\+- BroadcastExchange IdentityBroadcastMode, \[id=#1351]\
Explain it

#### Explanation of the Spark Physical Operator

**BroadcastExchange**

`BroadcastExchange` is a physical operator in Apache Spark that is used to broadcast a small DataFrame to all nodes in the cluster. This is typically done to optimize join operations where one of the DataFrames is significantly smaller than the other. By broadcasting the smaller DataFrame, Spark avoids the need for shuffling large amounts of data across the network.

**IdentityBroadcastMode**

`IdentityBroadcastMode` is a specific broadcast mode in Spark which implies that the broadcasted data should remain unchanged and be used as-is during the execution of the query. This mode preserves the original structure and content of the broadcasted DataFrame without any transformation or modification.

**\[id=#1351]**

The `[id=#1351]` part is an identifier used internally by Spark to uniquely identify this particular instance of the `BroadcastExchange` operator within the execution plan. This helps in tracking and debugging the execution process.

#### Summary

The operator `+- BroadcastExchange IdentityBroadcastMode, [id=#1351]` in your Spark physical plan indicates that:

* A small DataFrame is being broadcasted to all nodes in the cluster.
* The broadcast mode is `IdentityBroadcastMode`, meaning the data is used in its original form.
* The unique identifier for this operation within the plan is `#1351`.

Explain +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(input\[0, string, true])), \[id=#1475]

#### Explanation of the Spark Physical Operator

**BroadcastExchange**

`BroadcastExchange` is a physical operator in Apache Spark that broadcasts a small DataFrame to all nodes in the cluster to optimize join operations. When one DataFrame is significantly smaller than the other, broadcasting the smaller DataFrame helps avoid shuffling large amounts of data across the network.

**HashedRelationBroadcastMode**

`HashedRelationBroadcastMode` is a broadcast mode in Spark that uses hashed relations. This mode creates a hash map from the broadcasted DataFrame, where the keys are the values of the specified columns. This allows for fast lookups during join operations.

**List(input\[0, string, true])**

This part indicates the schema of the broadcasted data, where:

* `input[0]` refers to the first column of the DataFrame.
* `string` indicates the data type of the column.
* `true` indicates that the column allows null values.

**\[id=#1475]**

The `[id=#1475]` part is an identifier used internally by Spark to uniquely identify this particular instance of the `BroadcastExchange` operator within the execution plan. This helps in tracking and debugging the execution process.

#### Summary

The operator `+- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(input[0, string, true])), [id=#1475]` in your Spark physical plan indicates that:

* A small DataFrame is being broadcasted using a hashed relation broadcast mode.
* The broadcasted DataFrame has a schema where the first column is a string, and it allows null values.
* The unique identifier for this operation within the plan is `#1475`.
